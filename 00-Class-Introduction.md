## Class Logistics

- Class is from 9am to 5pm Eastern Time
- Class sessions are August 12â€“14
- There is a one-hour lunch from 12 to 1
- The lunch hour is sacrosanct, this gives you time to schedule non-class activities like phone meetings etc.
- There will be a 15-minute break roughly mid-morning and another roughly mid-afternoon

## Class Materials

- Materials for the class are in the [class repository](https://github.com/ExgnoRepos/C2403-Kotlin-August-12)
- All materials are in the repository and are available until September 14, 2024. 
- All materials in the repository are published under a creative commons or equivalent license that permits free sharing.
- We will be making extensive use of the online Kotlin documentation during class. Links to the documentation used will be cited in this material with additional reading and video links in the README file.
- This repository may be updated as additional resources are added during class.

## Lab Environments

- Each student will be provided with a web-accessible VM for use during the course.
- You are not required to use the provided VM. You may use your own computer; however, because of time limitations, neither setup guidance nor technical support can be provided for your own local machines.
- Documentation on using the VMs and a list of machine assignments is available in the `VMs` directory in the repository.
- Your VM is accessible continuously until approximately 6pm on August 14. 
- If you are going to log into the VM from multiple locations, please check the multi-login note in the `VMs` directory.

## About the Class

- This is not a _how to program_ class; it is assumed that everyone in class can write code in Java or a syntactically related language at an intermediate level.
- Since Kotlin is derived from Java, we will spend some time looking at the significant differences between Java and Kotlin
- We will focus on the Kotlin specific features like multi-platform development and coroutines
- There will be a high-level overview comparing Kotlin and Swift
- There will also be an emphasis on Kotlin idioms and best practices


## Introductions

Please introduce yourself briefly, we don't have a lot of time for this part. Main points to cover{

- The name you prefer to be called in class if different from the one listed on the class list
- Your area of professions focus (developer, SRE, tester, BA, hardware engineer, etc.)
- Your programming background and self-assessed skill level
- Any specific objectives for the class or specific items you want to learn.
- And to humanize things a little: one non-technical thing about you like a hobby or interest you enjoy.


## Class Protocols

- Please feel free to ask questions at any time. If you wait, you may forget details about what you wanted to ask.
- If you know that you will be absent or late, please advise me in advance, so I don't hold up the class waiting for you.
- At various points, I will go through the class list and ask you for feedback on how you are doing and how well you are understanding the material. Take this opportunity to identify any content you need me to explain further or go over again.
