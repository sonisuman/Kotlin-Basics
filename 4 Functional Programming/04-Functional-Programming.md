## Function Basics

[Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/functions.html)

We have already seen the basics of using functions in Kotlin

## Function Scope

Since functions are first class citizens, they scope similar to variables. In Kotlin, member functions, or functions defined as methods are in Java, work in the same way as Java methods.

### Local Functions

Local functions can be defined in other functions analogously to local variables. Any variables defined in the scope in which the function is defined can be reference as free variables.

This is shown in Demo 4.1

```kotlin
package demo_4_1

fun calculateFactorial(number: Int): Int {
    // Local function to calculate factorial
    // and a local free variable
    var freeVar = "Hi there"
    fun factorial(n: Int): Int {
        if (n <=1 ) println(freeVar)
        return if (n <= 1) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)
    }

    // Call the local function
    factorial(number)
    freeVar = "Bye Now"
    return factorial(number)
}

fun main() {
    val result = calculateFactorial(5)
    println("Factorial of 5 is: $result")  // Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120


}
```
```shell
Hi there
Bye Now
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## Higher-order functions and lambdas

[Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html)

Since functions are first class, they are like data in that they can be stored in variables, passed as parameters to other functions and be returned from other functions.

Functions that take other functions as parameters or return a function are called `higher-order functions` As shown below in Demo 4.2

```kotlin
package demo_4_2

// Higher-order function that takes a function as a parameter
fun performOperation(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
    return operation(a, b)
}

// Example functions to pass as arguments
fun add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
fun multiply(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x * y
fun doubled(x:Int) : Int = x * 2

fun main() {
    // Using performOperation with different operations
    val sum = performOperation(5, 3, ::add)
    val product = performOperation(5, 3, ::multiply)
    //val d = performOperation(4.::doubled)

    println("Sum: $sum")         // Output: Sum: 8
    println("Product: $product") // Output: Product: 15
}

```
```shell
Sum: 8
Product: 15
```
The `::add` notation in Kotlin is known as a function reference that allows a function to be passed as an argument to another function without actually invoking it. If the function was referenced directly, then the function would be executed and the result passed instead of the reference to the function.

## Function types

[Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html#function-types)

Like variables, functions are type in terms of the type and number of arguments they take and the type of their return value.

### Receiver types

This allows functions to be "added on" to a class definition as if they were defined as class methods. This was referenced in the previous module under extensions

This is shown in demo 4.3

```kotlin
package demo_4_3

class Person(var name: String, var age: Int)

// Extension function that uses Person as the receiver type
fun Person.introduce() {
    println("Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.")
}


fun main() {
    val person = Person("Alice", 25)

    // Calling the function with 'Person' as a receiver type
    person.introduce()
}
```
```shell
Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

### Anonymous functions

An anonymous function is a function without a name. Unlike a lambda, an anonymous function has a more traditional function syntax, which can include a return type and multiple statements within a block. Anonymous functions are useful when you need a function for a short duration or within a limited scope, but donâ€™t want to declare it globally or give it a name.

The basic syntax of an anonymous function is:

` 
fun(parameter(s)): ReturnType {  // function body }
`
```kotlin
package demo_4_5

fun main() {

    // Anonymous Function with No Parameters:
    val sayHello = fun() {
        println("Hello, World!")
    }
    sayHello()

    // Anonymous Function with Parameters:
    val multiply = fun(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a * b
    }
    val result = multiply(3, 4)
    println(result)

    // Anonymous Function with Implicit Return Type:
    // The return type can be omitted if it can be inferred
    val add = fun(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b
    val sum = add(15, 70)
    println(sum)

   // Anonymous Function as a Function Parameter:

    fun performOperation(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
        return operation(a, b)
    }
    val result1 = performOperation(8, 3, fun(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
        return x - y
    })
    println(result1)

}
```
```shell
Hello, World!
12
85
5
```

## Closures

A closure is a lambda expression or an anonymous function that captures and retains access to variables from its surrounding scope, known as free variables. These free variables are not defined within the lambda or function itself but are used inside it

In the example below, `sum` is a free variable.

```kotlin
package demo_4_6

fun main() {
    // Accumulator function as a closure
    val accumulator = createAccumulator()

    println(accumulator(5))  // Output: 5
    println(accumulator(10)) // Output: 15
    println(accumulator(3))  // Output: 18
}

fun createAccumulator(): (Int) -> Int {
    var sum = 0  // Free variable captured by the lambda

    return { value: Int ->
        sum += value
        sum  // The lambda returns the updated sum
    }
}

```
```shell
5
15
18
```

---

## Inline Functions

An inline function is a function where the compiler copies the function's code directly into the calling code instead of creating a function call. This can reduce the overhead of function calls, particularly for small functions or those that take lambda expressions as parameters. The main advantage of inline functions is to improve performance by avoiding the creation of additional function objects and eliminating the need for virtual function calls.

```kotlin
package demo_4_7

inline fun performOperation(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
    return operation(a, b)
}

fun main() {
    val sum = performOperation(3, 4) { x, y -> x + y }
    val product = performOperation(3, 4) { x, y -> x * y }

    println("Sum: $sum")       // Output: Sum: 7
    println("Product: $product") // Output: Product: 12
}

```

In the above example, when the `performOperation` function is marked as `inline`, the compiler will replace the function call with the actual code inside the function during compilation. This means that the lambda expressions `{ x, y -> x + y }` and `{ x, y -> x * y }` are directly inserted into the places where `performOperation` is called.
